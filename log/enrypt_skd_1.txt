I want to get the particular part of String from a complete word.

For example:

I have the following String.

# STRING_VALUES #
and a sentence is as follows

<p># STRING_VALUE #<br /># CMESSAGE #<br /># CUSTOMERADDRESS #<br /><br /></p>
From the above, I want to get the string as follows:

STRING_VALUES
CMESSAGE
CUSTOMERADDRESS
