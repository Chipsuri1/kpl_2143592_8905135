I want to get the particular part of String from a complete word.

For example:

I have the following String.

# STRING_VALUES #
and a sentence is as follows

<p># STRING_VALUE #<br /># CMESSAGE #<br /># CUSTOMERADDRESS #<br /><br /></p>
From the above, I want to get the string as follows:

STRING_VALUES
CMESSAGE
CUSTOMERADDRESS
How to do to get the above string? I am stuck with this.

What have you tried? Have you at least read the javadoc of the class String? – JB Nizet Sep 25 '12 at 11:02

"particular part of String"? Can you describe that particular part please? In that case, people will be able to help you easily. – Juvanis Sep 25 '12 at 11:03

Use split:

String ss ="# STRING_VALUES #";
String[] parts = ss.split("#");
System.out.println(parts[1].trim()); // STRING_VALUES
DEMO.
